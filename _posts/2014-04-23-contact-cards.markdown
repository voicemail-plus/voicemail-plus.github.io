1.3.1 has just been released into the app store. Along with the normal tweaks, we have three new features for you.

## Contact Cards

Contact cards make it easier to access the callers contact details or add them to your contacts if they do not already exist.

## Sharing

Maybe you need to share a voicemail with a co-worker or received a funny drunken voicemail and want to share the recording with friends. When viewing a voicemail you will now see a share button in the top right of the screen. This will let you share the transcription and audio recording via SMS/iMessage or email.

## Syncing Read State

I was finding that when I checked my voicemail from my email client, using the email forwarding feature, it was annoying that it would not mark the message as read on the iPhone app.

So now, when you open a voicemail in your email client, it will sync the read status with the app. No more pointless tapping, trying to mark everything as read.
