I was finding that when I checked my voicemail from my email client, using the email forwarding feature, it was annoying that it would then not mark the message as read in the iPhone app.

So now, when you open a voicemail in your email client, it will sync the read status with the app. No more pointless tapping, trying to mark everything as read.
