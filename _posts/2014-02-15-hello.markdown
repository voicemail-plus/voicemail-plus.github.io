It's been a long time coming but I'm proud to finally launch Voicemail+. Hector and I started Voicemail+ roughly just over a year ago, though it looked a lot different back then...

We built Voicemail+ to scratch our own itch, as they say. We had recently switched from an O2 iPhone contract, which came with visual voicemail to SIM only contract with 3 that didn't. It sucked. Looking around in the app store the only options were pretty ugly, had too many features and complex pricing plans.

So here we are; Voicemail+ offers a no-nonsense approach to visual voicemail, built to stay out of your way.
