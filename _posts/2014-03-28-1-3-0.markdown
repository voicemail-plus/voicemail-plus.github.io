Today we released a new version of Voicemail+. This is our first major update since launching Voicemail+ back in February.

The most heavily requested feature since launch has been custom greetings. A greeting is the audio that is played to a caller before they leave a voicemail. 

You can create your own greeting, or use one of our default greetings, by heading over to settings and tapping greetings.
