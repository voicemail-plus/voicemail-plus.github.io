  	<h2>Which carriers are supported?</h2>
    <p>Voicemail+ requires your carrier to support <b><em>conditional call forwarding</em></b>. If you're on a monthly contract plan your network should support this and you can activate and use Voicemail+.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, most carriers in the UK currently <b>do not</b> support this feature on PAYG plans. The exceptions are 3 and giffgaff which we <b>do</b> support.</p>
    <p>For now we only support carriers in the UK.</p>

  	<h2>How do I deactivate Voicemail+?</h2>
    <p>If you no longer wish to use Voicemail+ you <b>must</b> dial the deactivation number for your network. This will return your voicemail settings to their original network defaults and disable conditional call forwarding. You will then receive voicemail messages as you did before using Voicemail+.</p>

  	<h2>My messages aren't being transcribed accurately. Why not?</h2>
  	<p>We use a third party service called Plivo for our text transcriptions. Unfortunately these transcriptions are not always 100% reliable.</p>
  	<p>Our aim with text transcription is to at least give you the gist of the message, even if it's not a 1:1 transcription. This is an area we hope to improve on in the future.</p>

    <h2>I'm not receiving voicemail messages. Why not?</h2>
    <p>First of all, you should check and confirm that your voicemail messages are being forwarded to the Voicemail+ service.</p>
    <p>To do this, dial <code>*#62#</code> on your iPhone. You should see a series of messages, and the first one should read:</p>
    <pre><code>Setting Interrogation Succeeded<br />Voice Call Forwarding<br />When Unreachable<br />Forwards to <b>01225637017</b><br />Enabled</code></pre>
    <p>If you see a different number to the one above it means conditional call forwarding is not set up. Dial <code>*004*+441225637017#</code> to activate Voicemail+ and then <code>*#62#</code> again to confirm  the Voicemail+ number is now being used. You should now receive messages in the Voicemail+ app.</p>
    <p>If you're still not receiving new messages in Voicemail+ please contact our team using the contact details below.</p>
