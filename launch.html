    <p>We're rolling Voicemail+ out to our UK customers first before we do a global launch to ensure the best carrier compatibility we can.</p>
    <p>We've been testing with UK users for a few months and we're happy that our service will work across all UK carriers.</p>
    <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/voicemail+/id711526309?mt=8" id="app-store"><em>&#63743;</em> <span>Available on the UK </span>App Store</a></p>

    <p>Our aim will be to launch Voicemail+ in the US later this year. We're working on network and carrier compatibility right now to bring Voicemail+ to the US App Store as soon as we can.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to help us by beta testing the app on a US carrier then <a href="mailto:support@voicemailpl.us">drop us an email</a> with your UDID and carrier name.</p>
